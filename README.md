## How to install:
### Step 1
First make sure you followed [these](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/0_getting_started.html) install instructions to make sure you are using monogame 3.8, the latest version of monogame

### Step 2
Now download the repository, there are two ways to do this,

1. The best way to do this is by cloning the repository, this takes a little bit more set up, but will make it easier to keep Clockwork updates as I make updates.
For this you have to download a github client, for this example I will use [this one](https://desktop.github.com) made by github themselves.
When you have github client open, click on File in the top right, and than click on clone repository.
In this little window click on URL, and paste: "https://github.com/RealShiftless/Clockwork2D" without the parentheses in the url box, choose your location for it.
Now you have the github repository cloned.

2. Click on Code in the home of the repository, and click on Download Zip, export it to the location you want once downloaded.
